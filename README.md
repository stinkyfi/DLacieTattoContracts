## Run Contract Locally

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stinkyfi/DegenDwarfs.git
cd DegenDwarfs
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
